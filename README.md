## In today's repository, I created a customer segmentation of a mall and some analysis:monocle_face:

**1) Annual Income distribution**

We can see that most of people have income in range of $20 - $80 and the number of people with $60 income is above 35 person.


**2) Age distribution**

We gain information that the mall's customers are mostly 20-40 and 50 years old. There is an incline in the age between 40-50. Perhaps most of them donâ€™t like to go to the mall that much.


**3) Gender proportions**

Turns out, 56% of the customers are female, while male are only 44%.


**4) Annual income between genders**

<img align="center" width="370" height="370" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66349501/212290953-0e22e81f-3193-4239-82c7-16246bae76bf.png">

While the number of females is dominating, male holds the highest average annual income, which is above $60.


**5) Distribution of annual income by age**

<img align="center" width="370" height="370" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66349501/212291707-f2a28223-6ac9-46db-b52c-7c77d9188dcc.png">

People who are around 30 - 40 years old have the highest annual income, which makes sense since perhaps they already seniors at their workplace.


**6) Distribution of spending score by age**

<img align="center" width="370" height="370" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66349501/212292258-c52c23c3-6d4b-4525-860f-08164d033df1.png">

People who are around 20 - 40 years old have the highest spending score compared to people above 40 years old.


**7) Correlation between age and annual income**

<img align="center" width="660" height="370" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66349501/212292630-243d7ffe-636f-4694-96d2-e02a903f8e6c.png">

The plot makes sense because the annual income increases from age 20 to 40. However, it starts to incline when they reach above 40 years old. The higher the number, the annual income decreases. This scatter plot has the same pattern as the distribution plot.


**8) Correlation between age and spending score**

<img align="center" width="660" height="370" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66349501/212293534-1f787bd6-5b00-4680-bd56-05a812317276.png">

In this scatter plot, we can see that they are clearly separated. People in their 20s and 30s have the highest spending score, and the spending score decreases for people who are 40 and above.


**9) Correlation between annual income and spending score**

<img align="center" width="660" height="370" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66349501/212294411-c7ec2aed-23cb-4686-8baf-f793bccc4584.png">

This is the exciting part because we get to see how annual income influences spending score. In this plot, it is clear that the circles are forming bunch of clusters. The clusters are divided to these:
1. People with $0-40 annual income have 0-40 spending score
2. Pepole with $0-40 annual income have 60-100 spending score
3. People with $40-70 annual income have 40-60 spending score
4. People with $70-140 annual income have 0-40 spending score
5. People with $70-140 annual income have 60-100 spending score
