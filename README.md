## In today's repository, I created a customer segmentation of a mall and some analysis:monocle_face:

**1) Annual Income distribution**

We can see that most of people have income in range of $20 - $80 and the number of people with $60 income is above 35 person.

**2) Age distribution**

We gain information that the mall's customers are mostly 20-40 and 50 years old. There is an incline in the age between 40-50. Perhaps most of them donâ€™t like to go to the mall that much.
